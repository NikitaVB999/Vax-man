# Vax-man in Python
The first task of EA Software Engineering Program from Forage.com

Pac-Man is one of the world's oldest computer games. In this task, we are going to pay tribute to Pac-Man. 

We are building a new game called Vax-Man. The rules are similar to Pac-Man with several notable exceptions:

<li>	Vax-Man can kill a ghost if he comes into contact with it (vaccinates it).
<li>	Contact with a ghost does not kill Vax-Man.
<li>	Each ghost that has not yet been hit multiplies itself every 30 seconds (the infection grows).
<li>	The goal of the game is to collect all the dots before the number of ghosts grows to 32 times the original number.
